Things I need to do:
 Claw and arm test:
  * PIDF arm extender and roation
 
 Mechanum test:
  * Set it to opMode
  
 Autonomous:
  * Figure out how to import hardware (Alex- it isn't working)
  * 
  * 
  * Set linear op (with the times for all 4 secions)
  * Create a class for autnomous that we can use all the methods to easily create all 4 guys
  * Figure out how to program rotation?
 
 Full Program:
  * Create it, add mecanum, arm, and claw
  * create a way so that you press one button
    * it reaches out a grabs the pixel (this will be from the ground)
    * it deposits the pixel onto the backboard 
    * it hangs?
    * it shoots the airplane?
