Things I need to do:
 Full:
* make arm and clawwork
* test full mechanum
* program suspension
* lancher servo

Double check:
* mechanum
* arm
* claw
* autonomous

  * create a way so that you press one button 
    * it reaches out a grabs the pixel (this will be from the ground) 
    * it deposits the pixel onto the backboard 
    * it hangs?
    * it shoots the airplane?
