**CONTROLS**
Gamepad 1: Driver
    left stick x, strife?
    left stick y- forward and backward
    right stick x - rotation

Gamepad 2: arm
bumpers- close
triggers - open
left stick - claw
    y- nodder
right stick - arm
    y- rotator

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things I need to do:

Test:
* autonomous

DEBUG
* nodder is slow
* machanum has slow reaction time
* rotator falls down

Future projects
* button to make rotator and nodder level to ground
* it deposits the pixel onto the backboard 
* Hanging?
* Algorithm to make nodder level while rotator lifts
