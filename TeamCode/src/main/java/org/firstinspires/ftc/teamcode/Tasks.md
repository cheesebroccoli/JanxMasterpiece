Things I need to do:
 Claw and arm test:
  * PIDF arm extender and roation
  
 Autonomous:
  * Set the autonomous to do what they're supposed to do
 
 Full Program:
  * create a way so that you press one button
    * it reaches out a grabs the pixel (this will be from the ground)
    * it deposits the pixel onto the backboard 
    * it hangs?
    * it shoots the airplane?
